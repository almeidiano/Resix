## About

Resix is a IoT project created to launch fireworks with NodeMCU module and WiFi connection to anywhere with just WiFi connection.

## Observation
<b>There's no functionality of real fireworks launch, the purpose of this project <i>at this moment</i> is only for UI matters.</b>

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
You'll need to have a basic knowledge with:
- [React](https://reactjs.org) to manipulate the source-code
- [Expo](https://expo.dev/) open-source platform for making universal native apps for Android, iOS, and the web with JavaScript and React.

**Cloning the Repository**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/almeidiano/resix

$ cd resix
```

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ yarn
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

### Running

With all dependencies installed and the environment properly configured, you can now run the app. You need to run with <a href="https://expo.dev/">expo</a>

## Download

You can [download](https://github.com/almeidiano/resix/releases) the releases containing all versions of Resix.
